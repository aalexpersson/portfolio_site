          <p className='about-text'>Hello there! My name is Alexander Persson and I am a swedish student currently studying a bachelor's degree in software engineering at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. When I have completed my bachelor's degree I will also pursue  a master's degree in a field which I have not yet decided. <br></br>
          <br></br>I got my first computer when I was 10 years old and ever since then I have had a huge interest in gaming, programming, computers and technology in general. <br></br>
          <br></br>I am still figuring out exactly what I want to pursue full time so I do a little bit of everything. What I have found to be most fond of is backend development, more specifically data science and AI, but I do enjoy some frontend work once in a while!
